<b>Ansible</b>
<p>Ansible is written to be a model of the desired state of the system, making the managed nodes to be able to perform and provide instructions to run an application to the connected end devices. A system administrator is the one who handle and control the end devices as the instructions will be coming from the system administratorâ€™s personal computer to run and decide whether all of the connected personal computers will have these kinds of applications, such as LibreOffice, Python, Browser or not.</p>
